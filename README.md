# synacor-implementation

this is a header-based library for executing binaries complying with the specification outlined [https://challenge.synacor.com/](here). it doesn't fully comply (i.e. will crash prematurely following the binary provided by the challenge), but i wrote it on a stint at 6a.m. and i felt quite chuffed about it.

most remarkably, it complies (almost entirely) with the gnu c styling guideline. (:
